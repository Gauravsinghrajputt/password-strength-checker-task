Evaluated password strength and analyzed best practices for secure password creation.


# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation – Cyber Security Task 6

## 📘 Objective

Understand the key factors that make a password strong and evaluate different password examples using online password strength checkers.

---

## ✅ Steps Followed

1. Created multiple passwords with varying:
   - Lengths
   - Character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
2. Used online tools (e.g., [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com)) to evaluate their strength.
3. Noted down the scores and feedback for each password.
4. Identified patterns that made some passwords stronger than others.
5. Researched:
   - Common password attacks (brute force, dictionary attack)
   - Importance of password length and entropy
   - Best practices for strong passwords
6. Documented findings and tips in a report.

## 🧪 Sample Passwords Tested

| Password         | Strength Score | Feedback Summary                          |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `12345`          | Very Weak      | Too short, numeric only                   |
| `Password123`    | Weak           | Common word, predictable pattern          |
| `Pa$$w0rD@2024!` | Strong         | Good mix of characters, length, symbols   |
| `&mP9vL$z#xT7`   | Very Strong    | High entropy, unguessable, secure format  |

## 📘 Key Concepts Learned

- **Password Length** increases resistance to brute force attacks.
- **Character Variety** (symbols, cases, numbers) makes passwords harder to crack.
- **Avoid common words** and predictable patterns.
- **Passphrases** can be both strong and memorable (e.g., `Mango!River_Dog$Sky2025`).
- **Password Managers** can help store long, unique passwords for each service.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds extra security beyond passwords.

## 🔐 Conclusion

This task helped me understand how password complexity affects security, how attackers exploit weak passwords, and how to create strong credentials that resist attacks like brute force and dictionary cracking.
